<h2>Task 3.2: Analyzing Model Papers for Task Achievement</h2>

<p>In this course, you are expected to write about <b>1000 to 1500 words</b> including an <b>Introduction section</b> and a <b>literature review</b>. You may find the instructions here:</p>

<h3>Workflow Guide</h3>

<p>I've developed a <b>workflow</b> to guide you to analyze model papers and gain actionable insights that may inform your writing for this task as well as for academic publication. You can find the workflow here:</p>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p><b>Follow the steps</b> in the workflow to analyze model papers and <b>reply here</b> with a GitHub file path to your analysis results, similar to:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026/blob/main/literature/GFY*/task_achievement_analysis.html" target="_blank">https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026/blob/main/literature/GFY*/task_achievement_analysis.html</a></p>

<p><b>In your reply, also write a few words discussing:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>To what extent the analyses can inform your writing</li>
    <li>Key insights you discovered from analyzing the model papers</li>
    <li>How you plan to apply these insights to your own writing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>

<p><b>Deadline:</b> Please complete this task by <b>15 February</b> to allow sufficient time for the writing task (first draft by the end of February).</p>

<p><b>Scale of Analysis:</b> The analyses can be done on a few files or more (e.g., 50-100 papers). Whether a larger scale analysis can reveal more insights depends on various factors—we need to review it case by case.</p>

<p><b>Submission Format:</b> In your Moodle reply, include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The GitHub file path to your HTML analysis file (e.g., <code>PhDagentSpring2026/literature/[YourFolderName]/task_achievement_analysis.html</code>)</li>
    <li>A brief reflection on how the analysis informs your writing</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Example submission format:</b></p>

<blockquote style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #667eea; margin: 20px 0;">
<p><b>File path:</b> <code>PhDagentSpring2026/literature/[MyName]/task_achievement_analysis.html</code></p>

<p><b>Reflection:</b> I analyzed two model papers from my target conference focusing on Task Achievement (Aspects 1 and 2). The analysis revealed that both papers use evaluative language strategically in centrality statements, and they employ different but equally effective strategies for gap identification—one uses systematic enumeration while the other uses concrete examples. This has helped me understand what "extremely clear" research background and "clearly delineated" gaps look like in practice. I plan to apply these insights by incorporating similar linguistic patterns and gap-signaling strategies in my own introduction and literature review.</p>
