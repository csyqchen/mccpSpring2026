# My Reflection on Writing

## Writing Challenges and Difficulties

**What aspects of academic writing do you find most challenging?**
Since my research focuses on graph algorithms, I often need to formulate precise and abstract mathematical definitions and use clear examples to introduce my algorithms. This is usually the most challenging part of my academic writing.

**What specific difficulties do you face when writing Introduction/Literature Review?**
When writing the Introduction and Literature Review, I find it difficult to clearly identify the research gaps. Although I often understand the technical details of existing work, highlighting their limitations and motivating new research directions remains a challenge for me.

**What do you struggle with most?**
My biggest challenge is conducting critical analysis rather than just summarization. It is relatively easy for me to understand and summarize existing methods, but identifying deeper limitations and connecting them to meaningful future directions is more difficult.

## My Writing Process

**How do you approach writing Introduction and Literature Review?**
I usually start by clarifying the main research topic and identifying the key themes. Then I outline the structure before writing. I draft paragraph by paragraph and revise several times to improve clarity and logical flow.

**What steps do you take?**
1. Define the research topic.

2. Identify key concepts and related research areas.

3. Create a brief outline.

4. Write the first draft.

5. Revise and refine the structure and language.

**Do you have a particular method or strategy?**
I try to follow structured writing frameworks, such as organizing the Introduction using the three-move model and grouping the Literature Review by themes. This helps me keep my writing logical and focused.

## How I Use AI for Help

**Do you use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help with writing?**

Yes, I use AI tools such as ChatGPT to assist with my academic writing.

**How do you use them?**

I use AI for brainstorming research ideas, improving sentence clarity, checking grammar, and mainly use for refining paragraph structure.

**What prompts do you typically use?**

Polish the language of this paragraph.
Make the logic more coherent.

**What do you find helpful or not helpful about AI assistance?**

AI is very helpful in improving clarity and organizing structure. However, it cannot replace independent thinking. Determining the research direction and identifying existing research gaps still require my own analysis and judgment.

## My Goals

**What do you hope to improve in your writing?**

I hope to improve my ability to clearly identify research gaps and present them in a convincing way. At the same time, I want to strengthen my ability to define and describe my research problems and algorithms in a clear way.

**What specific skills do you want to develop?**

1. Research gap identification

2. Critical analysis of related work

3. Clear explanation of mathematical definitions and algorithms

4. Writing concise and precise academic sentences
