we need to align the image, texts and audio based on time 
figure out a way to identify the change of slide or major shift in the visual

create a new AnalyzePlan.md based on comments above

create a new 3MT_auto_analyze folder and move all the codes and video output (Areas/Professional Development/AItrainingFeb2026/ProcessYoutube) and analyses to it 

then move this over to Areas/Teaching/Courses/MCCP 6020/PhDagentSpring2026/pre3
